I have been working diligently to install kali-linux rolling
i managed to do so a few days ago.
Today i was getting familiar with how kali works i clicked something i don't think i should have.
When i closed out my terminal i was prompted with the message in the pic.
I checked the box and was booted fromm kali and have not been able to regain access.
Now, i've tried wiping the system and reinstalling which at times certain commands won't work
Somebody help please I'm youtubed out at this point and any previous steps i have written down aren't working
